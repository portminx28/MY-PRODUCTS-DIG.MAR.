              <br>1 1/2 lbs ground meat (pork, chicken or beef)
              <br>1 whole egg
              <br>4 cloves of garlic finely minced

              <br><Strong>Procedure:</Strong>
              
              <br>1.     Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper and mix well.
              
              <br>2.     Lay your wrapper in a plate. Take about a tablespoon of the filling and lay on top near the bottom end of the wrapper.<br> Form into a log shape.  Fold the bottom end over slightly tugging your filling down so it would be wrapped tightly.
              
              <br>3.     Fold the sides toward the middle.
              
              <br>4.     Start rolling up. Brush the top end of your wrapper with a little bit of water to seal the lumpia.
              
              <br>5.     Heat oil in a pan and deep fry your lumpia for about 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
              
              
              <br>6.     Pull out and let excess oil drip over a strainer or paper towel. Serve the Lumpiang Shanghai - Filipino Spring Rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or ketchup."</i></p>
